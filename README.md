# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio website! This project is a personal showcase designed to highlight my skills, projects, and professional journey. Below you'll find an overview of the key aspects that make up the website.

## Concept

The website was initially conceptualized around a corkboard bulletin board theme. However, to improve aesthetics and user experience, I transitioned to a modernized UI featuring a clean design with green as the primary tone, offering a fresh and professional look.

## Design Methodology

I implemented the Atomic Design methodology, structuring the project repository for better scalability and maintainability. This approach allows for the creation of reusable and interchangeable components, enhancing the overall flexibility of the website’s architecture.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Bun:** Chosen over npm for package management and scripts, leveraging its faster processing capabilities and improved developer experience.
  
- **Vite & React:** The website is built with Vite, providing a rapid development environment, and React for creating dynamic user interfaces.

- **Tailwind CSS:** Utilized for design and styling, offering a utility-first approach to craft responsive and modern design patterns efficiently.

## AI & LLM Integration

I’ve integrated a Large Language Model (LLM) feature to enhance user interaction:
- **Model:** Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2  
- **Hosting:** Deployed via Cloudflare Worker AI.

A dedicated UI for LLM messages has been added to enable seamless user interaction with the chatbot.

## Localization (i18n)

- Added multi-language support with full Korean localization, now set as the default language.  
- Implemented internationalization (i18n) to provide accessibility for a broader audience.

## Deployment

The website is deployed using Cloudflare Pages with Cloudflare Workers, ensuring fast, reliable, and scalable hosting. This setup delivers optimal performance and security for all visitors.

## Future Enhancements

- **Multi-language Support:** Expand to include more languages beyond Korean.  
- **Code Refactoring:** Improve code structure for better maintainability and scalability.  
- **Enhanced LLM Functionality:** Incorporate system prompts to optimize LLM responses.  
- **AutoRAG Integration:** Planning to use AutoRAG with Cloudflare R2 for automated file management, though associated costs are a consideration.
- **Theme Customization:** Plan to label all color tones as variables to enable theme customization through user selection, allowing users to change the theme according to their preferences.

*Note:* While I’d like to use AutoRAG with Cloudflare, it involves costs due to storage via R2.

## Project Process & Development

I have added detailed **Process** and **Development** sections within the Projects area to provide more insights into the development stages, challenges, and solutions I implemented.
