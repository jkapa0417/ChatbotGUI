Basic Concept of Atomic Design:
1. Atoms

The smallest building blocks of UI.
Single, fundamental elements such as buttons, labels, inputs, icons, color palettes, or typography styles.
No further subdivision usually makes sense.
2. Molecules

Groups of atoms functioning together as a unit.
Examples: a search input with a button, a label + input field, or a card header with an icon.
They form simple UI components.
3. Organisms

Complex components composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms.
Examples: header sections, navigation bars, footers, or product listings.
They form distinct sections of the layout.
4. Templates

Page-level structures that arrange organisms into a layout.
They define the skeletal structure of a pageâ€”much like a wireframe.
Focused on layout and composition, not actual content.
5. Pages

Specific instances of templates filled with real content.
They demonstrate how the UI appears with actual data.
