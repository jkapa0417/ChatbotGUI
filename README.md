# Portfolio ReadMe

Welcome to my portfolio website! This project is a personal showcase designed to highlight my skills, projects, and professional journey. Below you'll find an overview of the key aspects that make up the website.

## Concept

The website is conceptually designed around the theme of a chatbot, providing interactive and engaging user experiences. The design inspiration stems from a corkboard bulletin board, giving it a unique and personal touch.

## Design Methodology

I have implemented the Atomic Design methodology, structuring the project repository for better scalability and maintainability. This approach allows for the creation of reusable and interchangeable components, enhancing the overall flexibility of the websiteâ€™s architecture.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Bun**: I have chosen Bun over npm for package management and scripts to leverage its faster processing capabilities and improved developer experience.
  
- **Vite & React**: The website is built with Vite, providing a rapid development environment, and React for building dynamic user interfaces.

- **Tailwind CSS**: For design and styling, I utilized Tailwind CSS, which offers a utility-first approach to create responsive and modern design patterns efficiently.

## Deployment

The website is deployed using Cloudflare Pages with Cloudflare Workers, ensuring a fast, reliable, and scalable hosting solution. This setup helps in delivering optimal performance and security for all visitors.

## Future Enhancements

Looking ahead, I plan to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into the website. This will enable users to interact with the chatbot feature more effectively, allowing them to find information about me and my work more intuitively.
